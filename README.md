# MARACAS - MicroAlgae RnA-seq and Chip-seq AnalysiS

## What is MARACAS?

MARACAS is a computational pipeline specifically designed for the analysis of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq
data for **microalgae**. MARACAS starts processing raw fastq files and it generates lists of differentially 
expressed genes for RNA-seq data and lists of genomic loci in bed format for ChIP-seq data. The analysis
are performed according to user specified parameters. Reports in html and pdf format are produced for easy
exploration of the results. 

Differential expressed gene lists and genomic loci lists can be further analyzed using our online tool AlgaeFUN for
functional analysis.

MARACAS supports a wide range of microalge including:



MARACAS can be executed in a sequential mode in a laptop or server and in a distributed/parallel mode in a computer cluster.
